# Terminal Setup

## Install Homebrew

Open your terminal and run

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

On the last line, you should see `Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort` ...press `RETURN`

To check if everything was installed correctly, type `brew --version`

**Protip**: Typing `program --version` is a general way to confirm if something is installed

## Install ZSH

After that, we're going to use homebrew to install `zsh` and a related package to make it run correctly.

**Try `zsh --version` before installing it from Homebrew. If it's newer than 4.3.9
you _might_ be OK. Preferably newer than or equal to `5.0`.**

```sh
brew install zsh zsh-completions
```

To set zsh as your default shell, execute the following for **macOS High Sierra**

```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

(Relevant notes from https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#how-to-install-zsh-on-many-platforms)

## Install Oh My Zsh

Lastly, run the following command

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You may need to restart your terminal to see your updated zsh terminal
